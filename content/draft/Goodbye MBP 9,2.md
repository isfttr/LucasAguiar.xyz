After 10 years of use, it is time to let go of this reliable machine and embrace a somewhat unknown future of the Apple Silicon. Last Sunday I bought a brand new MacBook Air M2 because it was really cheap, being offered for less than half of the price on Apple Store. Over the years I had many reasons to postpone this purchase and part of these reasons have been the fact that this MacBook has beee so reliable. But being this reliable could take it so much. It is time to review why this time I had to say goodbye to it and embrace a new laptop.
# Battery
My main complaint for the last years has been the battery perfomance. I have been carrying the laptop to work and using it to study, read emails, or other light tasks not work related. Also when I'm at home, sometimes I have been watching classes on the TV and taking notes on the computer. The big problem with this simples routine is that the battery is not capable of holding more than two hours of charge. Sometimes the computer would simply shutdown with no charge left and no warning. This was really frustrating. Because of this I had to carry a charger everywhere. Luckily I have three chargers. One of them was always plugged at work, another one was always at my bag and the other one was always in box somewhere - I just found it today. Having to carry the charger and have to deal with it in a hurry because the battery was dying has been a bad experience.
# Software availability and using Open Core Legacy Patcher
This computer is not supported by Apple anymore. Because of this, I had to resort for many years on using Linux distributions that have been a great source of learning and pain. Eventually, I discovered Open Core Legacy Patcher (OCLP) which meant that I could use the latest MacOS version on this old computer. The problem with it has been that I don't have the confidence nor do I know how to do the proper maintenance of MacOS in this situation. It doesn't really seem to me that I can just press upgrade to MacOS Sonoma and everything will work out fine. But first things first.
I decided to play it safe and install MacOS Monterey on the computer because I didn't want to deal with a slow computer. It was the right decision because the computer worked fine. I only had a few problems with OneDrive throttling the CPU, which made me download a paid program to limit the CPU usage to 5% for certain processes. Eventually the problema ceased to exist, although it came back randomly two other times. But apart from that, the computer performs as well as it can be expected for a 10-year old computer.
Since it has been running so well, I have been using it as my daily driver. Because of that I wasn't too keen on trying to upgrade it to Ventura or Sonoma because I didn't wanted to brake it. So I was stuck on not updating the OS and having some softwares not being able to run because they required a later MacOS version. My personal take is that OCLP is not that beginner friendly. As I writing this I had to watch another video on how to format using OCLP because I really was afraid on how to proceed. Even when I was Linux distributions I found that hard. I don't know, maybe it is just me being overly cautious.
This feeling of being stuck forever in this version, not being able to know if the computer is secure or not, really soured my experience over the months. This feeling is probably due to so much spent using Linux and being used to update the packages every so often.
# CPU and Screen
The CPU has been getting really hot. One of the things that didn't really worked was the fan, or fans. I had to download a free application called [Macs Fan Control](https://crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control/download) to set maximum temperatures and maximum RPMs so that I could make the fans work and keep the computer cool. It works fine, but the fans pickup speed and also the computer can get really hot. The problem with this is that I cannot use the computer casually because it gets hot fast and the battery drains too fast.
Another factor is the screen that is small and it is low resolution. The computer can support high resolution external monitors but the main screen is terrible by today's standards. There is no alternative for this.
# What I will miss
The form factor of the MacBook Pro 9,2 is great. It is compact and rigid. After all theses years it really took a beating but stood well. The new MacBook Air computer that I bought is a lot thinner, almost to the point that it could be bent with little force being applied to it. I have no confidence in handling this computer the same way as I have been accustomed to. I already bought a case and a sleeve for it.
As I said, the size of the 13 inch laptop is the best for mobility. It is definitely heavy, but sturdy. This new 15 inch laptop is a lot bigger. It feels lighter when I hold it with both hands, but when holding with only one hand it feels almost the same. It can get into my backpack, but the corners are now pointing outwards, clearly showing that I am carrying something big.
One of the killer features of this laptop when compared to newer models has been the keyboard. It is backlit and has great key travel. It is from before all the problems that plagued the butterfly keyboards and that tarnished the MacBooks lineup for so long. One of the things that I always saw as background problem for those laptops has been the butterfly keyboards and more recently that TouchBar, which made no sense for me since the beginning.
The fact that it is an older computer was a freeing in the sense that I could carry it around like it was really not a big deal. Could leave it unattended in the library, knock it over, let it fall, let the dog walk on it, etc. Now with the new computer I have to be a lot more careful.
# Conclusion
I am happy with all this years with this computer. It really has served me well. It accompanied me from the undergrad days to my first job, and to this very day that I have been able to buy this new computer. I intend to stay with this new computer for many years to come, maybe even 10 years (?).
