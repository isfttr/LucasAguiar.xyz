## Experience

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), where I researched solar cells and photoluminescent chemical compounds. In 2019, I earned my Master's degree in Chemistry at UFG, focusing on perovskite solar cells and intellectual property. I also contributed to the first Specialization program in Intellectual Property at UFG, led by Professor Tatiana Martins.

Before joining UnB, I worked remotely at Lummiê Propriedade Industrial, gaining valuable experience in patent writing and prosecution. I honed my skills in evaluating documents, drafting technical reports, and providing expert support for judicial litigation in chemistry and materials science.
