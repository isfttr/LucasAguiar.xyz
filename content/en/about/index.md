Hi, my name is Lucas Fernandes Aguiar, born in Brazil and I'm a chemist, 
specialized in intellectual property, currently working at Universidade
de Brasília (UnB) as a patent prosecutor and researcher.

Graduated in Chemistry in 2016 at Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), working with academic research and development of devices that involved solar cells and photoluminescent chemical compounds. Concluded the Masters program in Chemistry in early 2019, working with perovskite solar cells and intellectual property at the same university. Concluded at the end of 2019, the first Specialization program in Intellectual Property at UFG headed by my advisor prof. Tatiana Martins. Started working remmotely at Lummiê Propriedade Industrial mainly focused on evaluation of documents, technical reports and technical support for judicial litigation in the areas of chemistry and materials science. On August 2021, I accepted an offer to start working at the finance department of the Perboni S/A transportation branch at Brasília, where I helped the management as a Senior Financial Analyst to review, replace and create new processes to make a turnaround in the company. Less than a year later, we had achieved success in almost all critical areas. In June 2022, started working as a Researcher at the University of Brasília (UnB) as a Patent Writer for the Intellectual Property Managing office (Nupitec/CITT/CDT).

# Work experience


## Visiting Professor at Universidade Federal de Goiás for the IP Specialization


## Patent prosecutor and researcher at Universidade de Brasília

## Financial Analyst (Senior) at Perboni SA 
*August 2021- June 2022*

Worked as the head of the financial management at the Transportation subsidiary of Perboni SA, Central-Log DF, responsible for vegetables and refrigerated meat transporting across multiple states, with a fleet of almost 150 trucks.

This is was a valuable experience for me because I could work with a large team at this subsidiary and also with a large number of suppliers everyday with negotiations involved. Communication and problem solving skills were needed everyday, even so because the company was making a turnaround in its operations, so on top of the day-to-day activities, a lot of work on new processes had to be done to succeed. Although it was just a year of work, the situation when I left was far better, with no payments pending to suppliers.
