Hi, my name is Lucas Fernandes Aguiar, born in Brazil and I'm a chemist, 
specialized in intellectual property, currently working at Universidade
de Brasília (UnB) as a patent prosecutor and as a PhD student at the Ceramic Materials and Nanotechnology Laboratory (LMCNano/FT/UnB).

With a strong foundation in chemistry, I hold a Bachelor's degree from Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), where I conducted research on solar cells and photoluminescent chemical compounds. In 2019, I completed my Master's degree in Chemistry at UFG with a focus on perovskite solar cells and intellectual property. My expertise in this field allowed me to contribute extensively to the first Specialization program in Intellectual Property at UFG, headed by my esteemed advisor, Professor Tatiana Martins.

Prior to joining the University of Brasília (UnB) as a Patent Writer for the Intellectual Property Managing office (Nupitec/CITT/CDT), I gained invaluable experience in patent writing and prosecution while working remotely at Lummiê Propriedade Industrial. I honed my skills in evaluating documents, drafting technical reports, and providing expert support for judicial litigation within the fields of chemistry and materials science.

My unique background in both chemistry research and intellectual property makes me an exceptional asset to UnB's patent writing team. As a Researcher, I leverage my extensive knowledge of perovskite solar cells to draft and prosecute patent applications for this cutting-edge technology, ensuring that our institution remains at the forefront of innovation and commercialization in this rapidly evolving field.

# Work experience

## PhD Student at LMCNano/FT/UnB under Professor Alysson Martins

*Since March 2024*



## Visiting Professor at Universidade Federal de Goiás for the IP Specialization

*During 2023*

In addition to my patent writing role, I proudly led two essential classes within Universidade Federal de Goiás' (UFG) Intellectual Property specialization. The first class focused on the intricacies of research grants and the existing legislation that fosters innovation in Brazil. I elucidated how these initiatives interconnect with heightened intellectual property awareness and the subsequent patent application process, both in the context of Brazilian industrial property legislation as well as the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system. By sharing my in-depth knowledge, I empowered students to navigate the complexities of securing grants and protecting their inventions through effective patent strategies.

## Patent prosecutor and researcher at Universidade de Brasília (UnB)

*Since June 2022*

As a senior patent writer at Universidade de Brasília, I honed my expertise in crafting complex patent documents for inventions in the fields of chemistry, pharmaceutics, and materials science. I collaborated closely with researchers and professors, extracting vital technical information to strengthen their patent applications and ensure a robust intellectual property foundation for their groundbreaking discoveries.

Moreover, I also have the responsibility for communicating intricate scientific concepts to the Brazilian Patent Office (INPI), skillfully drafting comprehensive responses that addressed their queries with precision and technical accuracy. My ability to navigate the nuanced language and requirements of patent law allowed me to effectively advocate for my institution's inventions, contributing to their successful protection and commercialization.

## Financial Analyst (Senior) at Perboni SA 

*August 2021- June 2022*

Worked as the head of the financial management at the Transportation subsidiary of Perboni SA, Central-Log DF, responsible for vegetables and refrigerated meat transporting across multiple states, with a fleet of almost 150 trucks.

This is was a valuable experience for me because I could work with a large team at this subsidiary and also with a large number of suppliers everyday with negotiations involved. Communication and problem solving skills were needed everyday, even so because the company was making a turnaround in its operations, so on top of the day-to-day activities, a lot of work on new processes had to be done to succeed. Although it was just a year of work, the situation when I left was far better, with no payments pending to suppliers.
