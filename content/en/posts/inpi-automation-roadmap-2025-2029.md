The Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) is embarking on a significant transformation of its patent services. A recent presentation detailed plans to replace the current web search system with a comprehensive, unified platform designed to streamline the entire patent process. This initiative promises to enhance efficiency, reduce user errors, and improve the overall experience for patent applicants and stakeholders.

## Current Challenges in the Brazilian Patent System

Currently, the INPI's patent system relies on several disconnected systems. These fragmented systems handle various stages, including application submission, GRU generation (payment slips), process consultation, filing submissions and requirement compliance, and internal examination stages (formality, technical aspects, nullity, appeals, etc.). This lack of integration often leads to duplicated effort and user confusion due to unfamiliar interfaces, complex instructions, and technical jargon in official communications.

## The Vision: A Unified Patent Service Management System

The core objective of the INPI's project is to consolidate all patent-related processes into a single, integrated system. By creating a unified platform, the INPI aims to:

* **Minimize Redundancy:** Eliminate duplicated tasks and data entry across different systems.
* **Improve User Experience:** Simplify the patent application process with a user-friendly interface and clear instructions.
* **Provide Contextual Guidance:** Offer users relevant options and information based on the specific stage of their patent application.

For example, if an application receives a formal requirement, the new system will guide the user to generate the GRU for compliance and submit the necessary documents, while hiding irrelevant options. This contextual approach is a significant improvement over the current system, where users may struggle to navigate the various options and requirements.

## Timeline and Key Milestones

The INPI plans to launch a limited-functionality version of the new portal in **October/November 2025.** This initial release will include essential features such as:

* User login
* GRU generation
* Process tracking

The complete rollout of the new portal is projected to span from 2025 to 2029.

## Focus on Examiner Efficiency and Consistency with AI Assistance

The INPI is also focusing on improving the efficiency and consistency of technical examinations. User feedback revealed the desire for examiners' decisions within two years of the technical examination request and greater clarity and legal certainty in decisions and technical opinions.

To address these concerns, the INPI plans to implement a writing assistant tool for examiners. This "Copilot" system will suggest standardized text related to legislation and relevant orders, helping examiners create consistent and comprehensive reports more quickly. The key is that **this is not about replacing examiners with AI**, but providing them with tools to enhance their work.

## Upcoming INPI Events

Mark your calendars! The INPI will host two broadcasts on **May 12, 2025, at 10:00 AM and 2:30 PM**.

## Conclusion

The INPI's automation project represents a significant step forward in modernizing Brazil's patent system. By streamlining processes, improving user experience, and leveraging AI to assist examiners, the INPI is paving the way for a more efficient and transparent intellectual property landscape. This transformation will benefit patent applicants, attorneys, and the overall innovation ecosystem in Brazil.
