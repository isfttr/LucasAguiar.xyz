Decided to have a Time Machine server at home, but the simplest solution didn't work so I took an old MacBook (A1181) out of retirement to use it as a TrueNAS server.
# Introduction
I tried to create a new server to only run a small instance of TrueNAS locally but it didn't work. The computer is just too old for the job, with only 2GB of RAM it can't sustain the service.
