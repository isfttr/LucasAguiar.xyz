      <description>I have been using the ananke theme since the inception of this blog. But recently I started to have all sorts of problems because of my lack of understading of how the contents folder is linked to the layouts folder and to the themes/ananke folder.

Investing more in my formation in technology right now could come as odd for most people because I already have a Masters in chemistry and a specialization in intellectual property and also happen to work in the field that I have specialized in.</description>
