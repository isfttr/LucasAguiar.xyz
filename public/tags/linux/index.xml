      <description>The MacBook Pro 9,2 is a model of the MacBook Pro that was released in June 2012.Â It has a 13.3-inch display, a 2.5 GHz or 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB or 750 GB hard drive.&#xA;My MacBook was bought around 2013 or 2014, don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly. It was bought new, with 4GB of RAM and 500 GB hard drive.</description>
