      <description>Abstract: This document details a troubleshooting process for a Proxmox cluster authentication failure that prevented users from logging into the web interface. The root cause was identified as a missing /etc/pve/access.cfg file, crucial for user authentication, likely due to corosync communication issues. The problem was resolved by restarting the pve-cluster service, forcing quorum, manually creating a minimal access.cfg file, and restarting the pveproxy service. Preventative measures include regular cluster health checks, automated configuration file backups, ensuring proper shutdown procedures, maintaining network stability, monitoring storage health, applying Proxmox updates, and careful permissions management.</description>

      <description>A really simple script for those that, for some odd reason, decided to run the Open WebUI server from inside a LXC.&#xA;The problem I really like the interface in Proxmox and i prefer it than dealing with Portainer for some services that are more accessed. This is the case for Open WebUI, which I use daily.&#xA;The problem I faced was the update process of the service, which I knew little about.</description>

      <description>The problem This week I have been searching for solutions to use domains with my applications running in containers in my MacBook Pro server. Yes, I have converted my MacBook Pro into a server, at least for now. The first solution was to use a Pi-Hole as a local DNS and it works fine, but the problem is that I have to specify ports to get into the applications and it gets annonying.</description>

      <description>The last months have been very exciting to me. The most exciting and difficult part by far is having my newborn son, whom is almost 3 months old. The other exciting part is that I finally understood that if I really like technology I should really invest in it.&#xA;Investing more in my formation in technology right now could come as odd for most people because I already have a Masters in chemistry and a specialization in intellectual property and also happen to work in the field that I have specialized in.</description>

      <description>I needed a easy and cheap way to integrate my vault with artificial intelligence. One of the ways would be to pay for subscriptions, which would be a high cost for me, since I am would not use the service that often. Another way would be to pay for a Cloud GPU service to run big queries, that would be unfeasible to run locally. Eventually I discovered OpenRouter, which seems to be the easiest to solution because I can access multiple models at a single place and also have a API that I can connect to other services.</description>
