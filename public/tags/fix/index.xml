      <description>This is a quick fix to a problem I experienced with Open WebUI, which was that custom models were not showing in the models list. There was nothing in the documentation or in the issues pointing to a solution. I decided to open a new issue 4 days ago and today the user @dcolley gave the missing information and it worked.&#xA;For some reason, custom models are not working when you use Direct Connections.</description>
