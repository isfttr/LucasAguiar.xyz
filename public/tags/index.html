Introduction This itch to have a private solution for AI came to me after I saw that OpenAI changed their settings on the playground section and does not allow for free users to test the models. With that I went to check Gemini but it was the same thing. Both of them are costing $20/month and for me it isn&rsquo;t worth it at the moment.

        Thoughts on the hu.ma.ne AI Pin

      I watched the presentation by hu.ma.ne founder earlier in the week at TED in May, and I thought the device, the Ai Pin, was really different from what we have, read smartphones. What is the use of something without a screen? Then I remembered that people used to have Pagers, but even then, Pagers had a screen with the number to call back. But I digress.
What really made me think was watching their launch video yesterday.

      The last months have been very exciting to me. The most exciting and difficult part by far is having my newborn son, whom is almost 3 months old. The other exciting part is that I finally understood that if I really like technology I should really invest in it.
Investing more in my formation in technology right now could come as odd for most people because I already have a Masters in chemistry and a specialization in intellectual property and also happen to work in the field that I have specialized in.

      The last months have been very exciting to me. The most exciting and difficult part by far is having my newborn son, whom is almost 3 months old. The other exciting part is that I finally understood that if I really like technology I should really invest in it.
Investing more in my formation in technology right now could come as odd for most people because I already have a Masters in chemistry and a specialization in intellectual property and also happen to work in the field that I have specialized in.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Hi, my name is Lucas Fernandes Aguiar, born in Brazil and I&rsquo;m a chemist, specialized in intellectual property, currently working at Universidade de Brasília (UnB) as a patent prosecutor and as a PhD student at the Ceramic Materials and Nanotechnology Laboratory (LMCNano/FT/UnB).
With a strong foundation in chemistry, I hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), where I conducted research on solar cells and photoluminescent chemical compounds. In 2019, I completed my Master&rsquo;s degree in Chemistry at UFG with a focus on perovskite solar cells and intellectual property.
