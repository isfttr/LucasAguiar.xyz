      The problem This week I have been searching for solutions to use domains with my applications running in containers in my MacBook Pro server.

The first solution was to use a Pi-Hole as a local DNS and it works fine, but the problem is that I have to specify ports to get into the applications and it gets annonying.

      The last months have been very exciting to me. The most exciting and difficult part by far is having my newborn son, whom is almost 3 months old. The other exciting part is that I finally understood that if I really like technology I should really invest in it.
Investing more in my formation in technology right now could come as odd for most people because I already have a Masters in chemistry and a specialization in intellectual property and also happen to work in the field that I have specialized in.

      The problem This week I have been searching for solutions to use domains with my applications running in containers in my MacBook Pro server. Yes, I have converted my MacBook Pro into a server, at least for now. The first solution was to use a Pi-Hole as a local DNS and it works fine, but the problem is that I have to specify ports to get into the applications and it gets annonying.

      I watched the presentation by hu.ma.ne founder earlier in the week at TED in May, and I thought the device, the Ai Pin, was really different from what we have, read smartphones. What is the use of something without a screen? Then I remembered that people used to have Pagers, but even then, Pagers had a screen with the number to call back. But I digress.
What really made me think was watching their launch video yesterday.
