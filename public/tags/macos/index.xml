      <description>The MacBook Pro 9,2 is a model of the MacBook Pro that was released in June 2012.Â It has a 13.3-inch display, a 2.5 GHz or 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4 GB or 8 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB or 750 GB hard drive.&#xA;My MacBook was bought around 2013 or 2014, don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly. It was bought new, with 4GB of RAM and 500 GB hard drive.</description>

      <description>I needed a easy and cheap way to integrate my vault with artificial intelligence. One of the ways would be to pay for subscriptions, which would be a high cost for me, since I am would not use the service that often. Another way would be to pay for a Cloud GPU service to run big queries, that would be unfeasible to run locally. Eventually I discovered OpenRouter, which seems to be the easiest to solution because I can access multiple models at a single place and also have a API that I can connect to other services.</description>
