      <description>This is a quick fix to a problem I experienced with Open WebUI, which was that custom models were not showing in the models list. There was nothing in the documentation or in the issues pointing to a solution. I decided to open a new issue 4 days ago and today a user gave the missing information and it worked.&#xA;For some reason, custom models are not working when you use Direct Connections.</description>

      <description>A really simple script for those that, for some odd reason, decided to run the Open WebUI server from inside a LXC.&#xA;The problem I really like the interface in Proxmox and i prefer it than dealing with Portainer for some services that are more accessed. This is the case for Open WebUI, which I use daily.&#xA;The problem I faced was the update process of the service, which I knew little about.</description>
