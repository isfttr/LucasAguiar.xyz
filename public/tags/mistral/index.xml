      <description>This is the part 2 of the first post about the a local AI assistant.&#xA;The main problem that I faced running the configuration was that I needed to run at least three commands on the terminal to get everything running. This is far from perfect, I wanted it to work just like a normal application.&#xA;First, I forked the imartinez/privateGPT repository into my own. You can visit it at isfttr/privateGPT.</description>

      <description>It surprised me how easy it was to build a local solution with Ollama.&#xA;Introduction This itch to have a private solution for AI came to me after I saw that OpenAI changed their settings on the playground section and does not allow for free users to test the models. With that I went to check Gemini but it was the same thing. Both of them are costing $20/month and for me it isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it at the moment.</description>
