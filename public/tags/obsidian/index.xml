      <description>I needed an easy and cheap option to integrate my vault with artificial intelligence. The easiest option could be to pay for subscriptions, which would be a high cost for me, since I am would not use the service that often to justify. Another option would be to pay for a Cloud GPU service to run big queries that would be unfeasible to run locally. This option seemed too cumbersome for my case.</description>
