      <description>It surprised me how easy it was to build a local solution with Ollama.&#xA;Introduction This itch to have a private solution for AI came to me after I saw that OpenAI changed their settings on the playground section and does not allow for free users to test the models. With that I went to check Gemini but it was the same thing. Both of them are costing $20/month and for me it isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it at the moment.</description>

      <description>I watched the presentation by hu.ma.ne founder earlier in the week at TED in May, and I thought the device, the Ai Pin, was really different from what we have, read smartphones. What is the use of something without a screen? Then I remembered that people used to have Pagers, but even then, Pagers had a screen with the number to call back. But I digress.&#xA;What really made me think was watching their launch video yesterday.</description>
